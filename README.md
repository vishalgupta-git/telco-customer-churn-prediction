## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, impacting revenue and growth. This project predicts which customers are likely to leave using historical data and machine learning.  

Key aspects of the project:  

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, distributions, and relationships. Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.  
- **Model Testing:** Evaluated multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate for churn prediction.  
- **Interactive UI:** Developed a **Streamlit interface** with dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons for user-friendly data input.  
- **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical features to numeric form for machine learning models.  

Goal: Provide a practical tool to help telecom companies identify potential churners and implement retention strategies.
